eHour is an open source time tracking tool for companies and organizations who need accurate information on how much time 

is spent on projects by their people

The primary objective is to keep time tracking as simple and user friendly as possible while still being very effective at 

measuring and reporting the amount of time your team spends on a project.

The main features are:

    create multiple projects per customer, assign multiple users to the same project
    have different start and end dates and hourly rates per user for each project assignment
    create default projects to which all users should be assigned (days off, sick leave, etc.) so you can keep track of 

those hours as well
    extensive turnover & hours reports on all customers, projects, users, departments or a selection of them
    configurable localization and currency. eHour is available in English, Dutch, French, Italian, German (partial) and 

Polish (partial).
    separation of user, reporting and administration role.
    excel export of all your reports
    webbased user interface, no software needs to be installed on desktop machines

eHour is developed in Java using Scala, Spring, Hibernate and Wicket technology.

    =================
  	
		Before you deploy eHour in Tomcat you have to configure the database connection, make sure that Tomcat 

isn't running.

In the D:/ehour/tomcat directory of the eHour distribution there is a  ehour_mysql.xml and ehour_postgresql.xml config 

file. Open the appropiate file in a text editor and replace the following:

1.The first line contains: Set the location of the web archive

	<Context path="/ehour" reloadable="false" cookies="true" docBase="/opt/ehour/app/ehour-1.1.war">

	Replace the path /opt/ehour/app/ehour-1.1.war with the path to your WAR file. It's in the eHour Home directory's 	

	app folder.

ex:
	<Context path="/ehour" reloadable="false" cookies="true" docBase="D:/ehour/app/ehour-1.1.war">

2.The second line reads: Set the location of the eHour Home directory

	<Parameter name="EHOUR_HOME" value="/opt/ehour" override="true" />

	Replace /opt/ehour with the path to the eHour Home directory.
ex:
	<Parameter name="EHOUR_HOME" value="D:/ehour" override="true" />

3.Have Tomcat connect to your database:

	Replace the following fields: 

Original value		Replace with
==============          =============

%ehour.db.username%     the database username

%ehour.db.password%     the database password

%ehour.db.hostname%     the hostname/IP address of your database server

%ehour.db.name%	        the eHour database name


ex:mysql

username="root"
password=""
driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/timesheet?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull&amp;useOldAliasMetadataBehavior=true"


When you're done editing save this file as ehour.xml in the "conf/Catalina/localhost" directory in your Tomcat install 

directory. You need to create this directory if you haven't started Tomcat before.

note: Make sure you rename the file to ehour.xml



start tomcat:
==============

http://localhost:8080/ehour


login credential:

username=admin  password=admin
